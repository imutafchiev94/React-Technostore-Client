## Documentation
Only admin can add products, categories and subCategories. If you are authenticated you can add review to product, add rate to product and add products to cart and make orders. Not authenticated users can only see the products in the site.
You can find only TVs, Monitors, Laptops, Computers, Mices, Headsets and keyboards.
In This Project I use Context to store the user and products in cart.
